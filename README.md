<h2 align="center">AT Proto WhiteWind | Blog Template</h2>

This is a personal website and blog built with the **[AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)**, **[WhiteWind](https://whtwnd.com/about)**, and **Next.js**. The architecture of the project is based on Ports and Adapters, but it's very simple to understand, use, and customize.
