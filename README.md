<h2 align="center">AT Proto WhiteWind | Blog Template</h2>

This is a personal website and blog built with **[AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)**, **[WhiteWind](https://whtwnd.com/about)**, and **Next.js**. The architecture of the project is based on Ports and Adapters, yet it is straightforward to understand, use, and customize.

It is inspired by the **[AT Proto](https://atproto.com)** and **[WhiteWind](https://whtwnd.com)** projects, as well as [@haileyok](https://github.com/haileyok). This template serves as an excellent starting point for a personal website or blog.
